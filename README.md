# ChrysaLisp

ChrysaLisp is a 64-bit, MIMD, multi-CPU, multi-threaded, multi-core, multi-user
parallel operating system with features such as a GUI, terminal, OO Assembler,
class libraries, C-Script compiler, Lisp interpreter, debugger, profiler,
vector font engine, and more. It supports MacOS, Windows, and Linux for x64,
Riscv64 and Arm64 and eventually will move to bare metal. It also allows the
modeling of various network topologies and the use of ChrysaLib hub_nodes to
join heterogeneous host networks. It has a virtual CPU instruction set and a
powerful object and class system for the assembler and high-level languages. It
has function-level dynamic binding and loading and a command terminal with a
familiar interface for pipe-style command line applications. A Common Lisp-like
interpreter is also provided.

ChrysaLisp can be used on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Supports x64, arm64 and
riscv64 CPUs. It also supports a VP64 software CPU emulator used for the
install process, but this can be used, with the `-e` option, on platforms where
no native CPU support currently exits, as the runtime system. It runs on a
hosted environment while experimentation is being done, but eventually it will
be transitioned to run on bare metal. In the future, I plan to create a VM boot
image for UniKernel appliances and a WebAssembly target for use within web
browsers.

ChrysaLisp allows for the simulation of various network topologies utilizing
point-to-point links. Each CPU in the network is represented as a separate host
process, and point-to-point links utilize shared memory to simulate CPU-to-CPU,
bidirectional connections. The design intentionally does not include global
bus-based networking.

The ChrysaLib project, https://github.com/vygr/ChrysaLib, enables the use of IP
and USB3/USB2 Prolific chip "copy" cables to create heterogeneous host
networks. This allows users to connect their MacBooks, Linux, Windows machines
and PI4's to create their own development LAN or WAN networks, which is pretty
cool.

ChrysaLisp uses a virtual CPU instruction set to eliminate the use of x64,
ARM64, RISCV64, or VP64 native instructions. Currently, it compiles directly to
native code, but it has the capability to also be translated to byte code form
and use runtime translation.

To avoid the need for register juggling for parameter passing, all functions
define their register interface, and parameter sources and destinations are
automatically mapped using a topological sort. If non-DAG mappings are
detected, the user can address them with a temporary. The software also
includes operators to make it easy to bind parameters to dynamic bound
functions, relative addresses, auto-defined string pools, references, and local
stack frame values. Output parameters that are not used can be ignored with an
underscore.

ChrysaLisp has a powerful object and class system that is not limited to just
the assembler but is quite as capable as a high level language. It allows for
the definition of static classes or virtual classes with inline, virtual,
final, static, and override methods. The GUI and Lisp are built using this
class system.

It has function-level dynamic binding and loading. Functions are loaded and
bound on demand as tasks are created and distributed. Currently, functions are
loaded from the CPU file system where the task is located, but in the future,
they will come from the server object that the task was created with and will
be transported across the network as needed. Functions are shared among all
tasks that use the same server object, so only one copy of a function is
loaded, regardless of how many tasks use it.

The system functions are accessed through a set of static classes, which makes
it easy to use and eliminates the need to remember static function locations,
and also decouples the source from changes at the system level. The interface
definitions for these functions can be found in the *sys/xxx.inc* files.

A command terminal with a familiar interface for pipe style command line
applications is provided with args vector, stdin, stdout, stderr etc. Classes
for easy construction of pipe masters and slaves, with arbitrary nesting of
command line pipes. While this isn't the best way to create parallel
applications it is very useful for the composition of tools and hides all the
message passing behind a familiar streams based API.

A Common Lisp like interpreter is provided. This is available from the command
line, via the command `lisp`. To build the entire system type `(make)`,
calculates minimum compile workload, or `(make-all)` to do everything
regardless, at the Lisp command prompt. This Lisp has a C-Script 'snippets'
capability to allow mixing of C-Script compiled expressions within assignment
and function calling code. An elementary optimize pass exists for these
expressions. Both the virtual assembler and C-Script compiler are written in
Lisp, look in the *lib/asm/code.inc*, *lib/asm/xxx.inc*, *lib/asm/func.inc*,
*lib/trans/x86_64.inc*, *lib/trans/arm64.inc* and *lib/asm/vp.inc* for how this
is done. Some of the Lisp primitives are constructed via a boot script that
each instance of a Lisp class runs on construction, see *class/lisp/root.inc*
for details. The compilation and make environment, along with all the compile
and make commands are created via the Lisp command line tool in
*lib/asm/asm.inc*, again this auto runs for each instance of the `lisp` command
run from the terminal. You can extend this with any number of additional files,
just place them after the lisp command and they will execute after the
*lib/asm/asm.inc* file and before processing of stdin.

Don't get the idea that due to being coded in interpreted Lisp the assembler
and compiler will be slow. A fully cleaned system build from source, including
creation of a full recursive pre-bound boot image file, takes on the order of 2
seconds on a 2014 MacBook Pro ! Dev cycle `(make)` and `(remake)` under 0.5
seconds. It ain't slow !

Network link routing tables are created on booting a link, and the process is
distributed in nature, each link starts a flood fill that eventually reaches
all the CPU's and along the way has marked all the routes from one CPU to
another. All shortest routes are found, messages going off CPU are assigned to
a link as the link becomes free and multiple links can and do route messages
over parallel routes simultaneously. Large messages are broken into smaller
fragments on sending and reconstructed at the destination to maximize use of
available routes.

The `-run` command line option launches tasks on booting that CPU, such as the
experimental GUI (a work in progress, `-run gui/gui/gui.lisp`). You can change
the network launch script to run more than one GUI session if you want, try
launching the GUI on more than CPU 0, look in *funcs.sh* at the `boot_cpu_gui`
function ! :)

The `-l` command line option creates a link, currently up to 1000 CPU's are
allowed but that's easy to adjust. The shared memory link files are created in
the tmp folder */tmp*, so for example */tmp/000-001* would be the link file for
the link between CPU 000 and 001.

An example network viewed with ps looks like this for a 4x4 mesh network:

```code
./main_gui -l 011-015 -l 003-015 -l 014-015 -l 012-015
./main_gui -l 010-014 -l 002-014 -l 013-014 -l 014-015
./main_gui -l 009-013 -l 001-013 -l 012-013 -l 013-014
./main_gui -l 008-012 -l 000-012 -l 012-015 -l 012-013
./main_gui -l 007-011 -l 011-015 -l 010-011 -l 008-011
./main_gui -l 006-010 -l 010-014 -l 009-010 -l 010-011
./main_gui -l 005-009 -l 009-013 -l 008-009 -l 009-010
./main_gui -l 004-008 -l 008-012 -l 008-011 -l 008-009

./main_gui -l 000-004 -l 004-008 -l 004-007 -l 004-005
./main_gui -l 003-015 -l 003-007 -l 002-003 -l 000-003
./main_gui -l 002-014 -l 002-006 -l 001-002 -l 002-003

./main_gui -l 000-012 -l 000-004 -l 000-003 -l 000-001 -run gui/gui
```

## Getting Started

Take a look at the `docs/intro.md` for instructions to get started on all the
supported platforms.

The experimental GUI requires the **SDL2** library to be installed.

Get them via your package manager, on Linux with:

```code
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

Or on Mac via Homebrew.

```code
brew install sdl2
```

## Make/Run/Stop

Take a look at the `docs/intro/intro.md` for platform specific instructions. The
following is for OSX and Linux systems. Windows has a pre-built main.exe
provided, or you can configure Visual Studio to compile things yourself if you
wish.

### Installing

The first time you download ChrysaLisp you will only have the vp64 emulator
boot image. You must create the native boot images the first time round. This
is a little slower than subsequent boots and system compiles but allows us to
keep the snapshot.zip file as small as possible.

If on Linux or Mac via Homebrew:

```code
make install
```

Or on Windows

```code
install.bat
```

### Make

```code
make
```

### Run

```code
./run_tui.sh [-n num_cpus] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Text user interface based fully connected network. Each CPU has links to every
other CPU. Careful with this as you can end up with a very large number of link
files and shared memory regions. CPU 0 launches a terminal to the host system.

```code
./run.sh [-n num_cpus] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Fully connected network. Each CPU has links to every other CPU. Careful with
this as you can end up with a very large number of link files and shared memory
regions. CPU 0 launches a GUI.

```code
./run_star.sh [-n num_cpus] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Star connected network. Each CPU has a link to the first CPU. CPU 0 launches a
GUI.

```code
./run_ring.sh [-n num_cpus] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Ring connected network. Each CPU has links to the next and previous CPU's. CPU
0 launches a GUI.

```code
./run_tree.sh [-n num_cpus] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Tree connected network. Each CPU has links to its parent CPU and up to two
child CPU's. CPU 0 launches a GUI.

```code
./run_mesh.sh [-n num_cpus on a side] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Mesh connected network. Each CPU has links to 4 adjacent CPU's. This is similar
to Transputer meshes. CPU 0 launches a GUI.

```code
./run_cube.sh [-n num_cpus on a side] [-e] [-b base_cpu]
```

Cube connected network. Each CPU has links to 6 adjacent CPU's. This is similar
to TMS320C40 meshes. CPU 0 launches a GUI.

### Stop

Stop with:

```code
./stop.sh
```

### Snapshot

Snapshot with:

```code
make snapshot
```

This will create a *snapshot.zip* file of the *obj/* directory containing only
the host directory structures, the pre-compiled Windows *main_gui.exe* and
*main_tui.exe* plus the VP64 *boot_image* files !

Used to create the more compact *snapshot.zip* that goes up on Github. This
must come after creation of `(make-all-platforms)` *boot_image* set !

```code
obj/vp64/VP64/sys/boot_image
obj/x86_64/WIN64/Windows/main_gui.exe
obj/x86_64/WIN64/Windows/main_tui.exe
```

### Clean

Clean with:

```code
make clean
```
